# AtBay Pest Control

Mobile application developed by Kahero Harriott, Kobin Kempe, Anuja Mehta, and Nolan Raghu.

The goal of the project is to create a mobile interface to subscribe for pest control product delivery plans.

AtBayPestControl.apk is a downloadable android app. You can also visit https://expo.io/@kobinkempe/projects/AtBayPestControl to use your expo app on Android or a simulator to view the app. The app has yet to be deployed to iOS, but can be run using Expo CLI on your IDE with the code and the Expo app on iOS.
