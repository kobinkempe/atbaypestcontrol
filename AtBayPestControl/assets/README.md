# Assets folder
This folder contains a lot of the files, text, etc. that the app uses. Most edits to change the app will occur here. Here's what you can find in each directory:
## Classes
This directory contains the classes that are referenced as objects throughout the program.
## Data
This directory contains the data that is used to populate the information in the app, such as product and bug information, details about who to contact when there are issues, etc. See the readme within the directory for more information
## StyleSheets
This contains the stylesheet, which can be used to change colors, margins, and design of any specific components. All of the colors used are listed at the top of the file, where they are easy to edit.
## fonts
We haven't done anything with this... I suppose it may be possible to change the font from here
## images
All our images are here. Look for index.ts, where they are made into usable variables, which can be referenced throughout the app
## text
This contains all the text used in the app! Use it to change the title, tab names, or any of the text in the app. It is organized by the screen it is used in, besides some of the text that could be used in multiple screens easily
