## Some important notes
This is the root directory that you should open in your IDE. We have been developing this with Webstorm, using the Expo framework and the Yarn package manager. You should be able to run `yarn install` to add the necessary dependencies, as well as following any instructions to add yarn and expo.
The highest level file in the app is App.tsx. Here's some important starting places to look:
## Assets
In this folder, you will find most everything you need to make changes to the look, text, or pictures in the app, and even the class structures. In here you can find important notes as well.
## Navigation
This folder contains all the navigators, which control the way you switch between screens in the app. The screens are essentially loaded in to the navigators
## Screens
This folder holds the code for each screen and controls the front end functionality.
## Components
These front end components are often used in the screens.
## Redux
This contains some basic state functions for managing the app state and making sure screens refresh when necessary.
